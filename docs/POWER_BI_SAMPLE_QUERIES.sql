-- =========================================================================
-- PARAMETER QUERIES (For Dynamic Date Ranges)
-- =========================================================================
-- In Power BI, create parameters: StartDate, EndDate
-- Then use them in WHERE clauses like this:
-- =========================================================================

-- Example with parameters:
/*
SELECT 
    symbol,
    timestamp,
    close_price,
    volume
FROM FINANCIAL_DB.CORE.STOCK_DATA
WHERE timestamp >= @StartDate 
    AND timestamp < @EndDate
ORDER BY symbol, timestamp;
*/


-- =========================================================================
-- NOTES:
-- =========================================================================
-- 1. All timestamps are in UTC timezone
-- 2. Market hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST (14:30 - 21:00 UTC)
-- 3. Crypto data is 24/7 (including weekends)
-- 4. Stock data: Monday-Friday only (market days)
-- 5. Each stock has ~390 minutes of data per day
-- 6. Each crypto has ~1,440 minutes of data per day
--
-- Performance Tips:
-- - Use WHERE clause to limit date range
-- - Pre-aggregate data when possible
-- - Use Import mode for historical data
-- - Use DirectQuery only for real-time needs
-- - Create Snowflake views for complex queries
