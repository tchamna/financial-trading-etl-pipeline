    df_vehiclestypes = df_2.withColumn("vehicletype_id", row_number())
    return df_vehiclestypes
```

#### Financial Pipeline
```python
# Advanced technical indicators with windowing
def calculate_technical_indicators(self, df):
    window_20 = Window.partitionBy("symbol").orderBy("timestamp").rowsBetween(-19, 0)
    
    return df \
        .withColumn("rsi_14", self.calculate_rsi(col("close"), 14)) \
        .withColumn("bollinger_upper", avg(col("close")).over(window_20) + 
                   2 * stddev(col("close")).over(window_20)) \
        .withColumn("macd", self.calculate_macd(col("close"))) \
